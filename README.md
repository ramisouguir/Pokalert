# Pokalert <br />
Mod that uses entity NBT data to identify Pokemon of interest and highlight them in the world. Works on servers and single-player, allows for the user to be alerted on their desktop when a Pokemon of interest spawns.

*Important* <br />
In order to compile source code for the project, make sure to add the 1.12.2 version of Pixelmon into the "libs" folder. GitHub would not allow me to upload the mod myself as it was too big.
